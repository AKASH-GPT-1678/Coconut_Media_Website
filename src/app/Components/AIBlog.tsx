            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a foundational component of modern-day technology, re-shaping all facets of our lives
                from work to communication, learning and creation. Arguably, one of the most memorable developments in AI is OpenAI’s
                ChatGPT, which transformed the way we interact with computers by using natural language processing. However, with the
                maturation of the AI industry, competitors of ChatGPT are crystallizing, resulting in new functionalities and contention.
                In this blog, we will examine the accelerating growth of artificial intelligence in society, the emergence of AI language
                models, and the up-and-coming generative AI startups that will define the future evolution of AI.
            </p>

            <h5 className="text-4xl font-bold">How Artificial Intelligence Works?</h5>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence is artificial thinking and human-like competitive intelligence using algorithms that allow the
                machine to learn, reason, and make decisions. The working of artificial intelligence is “gathering” data, processing it
                through machine learning models, and then generating intelligent output. Over a prolonged period, artificial intelligence
                builds over time by compiling previous investigations and data, and this can result in improved accuracy, prediction, and
                decision-making.
            </p>

            <h5 className="text-4xl font-bold">Categories of Artificial Intelligence</h5>
            <p>The best way to approach understanding AI is through its categorization. So, what are the types of artificial intelligence?</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Narrow AI (Weak AI):</strong> Focused on specific tasks (e.g., voice assistants like Siri).</li>
                <li><strong>General AI (Strong AI):</strong> A proposed form of AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can perform.</li>
                <li><strong>Super AI:</strong> Hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all fields.</li>
                <li><strong>Reactive Machines:</strong> Basic systems that respond to inputs (e.g., IBM’s Deep Blue).</li>
                <li><strong>Limited Memory:</strong> Can learn from a set of historical memories (i.e., self-driving cars).</li>
                <li><strong>Theory of Mind:</strong> In development; understands emotions and thoughts.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-Aware AI:</strong> The most advanced form of AI; still theoretical and has consciousness and self-awareness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 className="text-4xl font-bold">How Would You Define Generative AI?</h5>
            <p>
                Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence, models that have been created with code to create new content. The
                models create text, images, audio, and even code based on prompts. Examples of these models include ChatGPT, DALL-E, and
                MidJourney. These models were trained on large multimodal datasets and use deep learning, and more specifically,
                transformer-type architectures, to generate and predict outputs.
            </p>
            <div className="p-6 space-y-8">
                <h5 className="text-4xl font-bold">Variations of Generative AI</h5>
                <p>There are many types of generative AI, which vary by the type of output they produce:</p>
